# cs238-windfarm
Final Project for CS238: Decision Making Under Uncertainty course at Stanford University (https://web.stanford.edu/class/aa228/cgi-bin/wp/). We optimized wind turbine placement in a wind farm, subject to wake effects, using Q-learning. For this project, I collaborated with Yu Shen Lu and Peiyun Zhu.
