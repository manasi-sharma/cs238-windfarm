## Final Project -- Optimizing Wind Turbine Placement Subject to Turbine Wakes
This is the code for the Final Project for CS238: Decision Making Under Uncertainty course at Stanford University (https://web.stanford.edu/class/aa228/cgi-bin/wp/). For this project, I collaborated with Yu Shen Lu and Peiyun Zhu.

We optimized wind turbine placement in a wind farm, subject to wake effects, using Q-learning. I worked especially on utilizing Q-learning in conjunction with Neural Networks to estimate the Q-values of unvisited states.
